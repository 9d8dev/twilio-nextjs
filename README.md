## Overview

This is a very simple template to get started with Twilio two step text verification using the NextJS App Router and Twilio's API.

It consists of a form and an API route to manage text code verification.

The original business need for this app was verifying phone numbers for user sign-ups to prevent spam. Seeing that there was not a simple template / example using NextJS, we created this basic template for public use and contribution.

## Getting Started

Clone repository and run ...

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```
