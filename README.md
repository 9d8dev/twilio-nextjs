## Overview

The `twilio-next-template` is a simple and efficient way to get started with Twilio's two-step text verification using the NextJS App Router and Twilio's API. It is primarily built with JavaScript (96.3%) and CSS (3.7%). This application was created to verify phone numbers for user sign-ups to mitigate spam. This project uses [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) and [Toast](https://sonner.emilkowal.ski/) for UI elements.
