## Overview

The `twilio-next-template` is a simple and efficient way to get started with Twilio's two-step text verification using the NextJS App Router and Twilio's API. It is primarily built with JavaScript (96.3%) and CSS (3.7%). This application was created to verify phone numbers for user sign-ups to mitigate spam. This project uses [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) and [Sonner](https://sonner.emilkowal.ski/) (for toasts) for UI elements. It is developed and maintained by 9d8, a development studio by Cameron Youngblood and Bridger Tower.

## Getting Started

To get started with the `twilio-next-template`:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Run the following commands:

   ```bash
   npm i
   ```
3. Add a `.env` file with your own API keys from Twilio. To find Twilio API keys, navigate to the [Twilio Console](https://twilio.com/console). Youâ€™ll be able to find your Account SID and Auth Token on the main dashboard of the console. Copy these values and paste them into your `.env` file as the values for TWILIO_SID and TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN respectively. You will also need to create a "[verify service](https://www.twilio.com/console/verify/services)" in the Twilio console. Find the service ID of your Twilio service to paste into VERIFICATION_SID. Example names of the ` env` variables are located in the `.env.example` file in the root directory of this repository.
4. Next, run the following command:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
Then open `http://localhost:3000` with your browser to see the result.
